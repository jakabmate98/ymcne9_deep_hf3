Topic: Weather forecast with neural networks

Source data: http://idojarasbudapest.hu/archivalt-idojaras

With weather datas from October to December (2011-2020) I predicted 3 dates' highest and lowest temperature: <br />
2020-10-28, 2020-11-03, 2020-11-24

For input data I used the previous day's lowest temperature, year and day of year

Results for asked days in the uploaded notebook:
2020-10-28 00:00:00  min_value:  11.742757797241211 , max value:  16.329105377197266 <br />
2020-11-03 00:00:00  min_value:  10.455301284790039 , max value:  14.721114158630371 <br />
2020-11-24 00:00:00  min_value:  5.39286470413208 , max value:  9.246733665466309 <br />

We'll see! ;)
